During my internship, I worked under the mentorship of **Mr. Sohil Patel** and **Mr. Ankur Mehta**. My responsibilites included, but were not limited to the following:

- Learnt a lot of Machine Learning and Data Science concepts from scratch under the guidance of some seasoned Data Scientists.
- Implemented what I learnt by writing Python code to analyse the data from various environmental sensors and gained some useful and actionable insights.
- Developed a Machine Learning project in which we detected plant diseases just by using images of the plant stem and leaves. Prepared my own dataset with 500+ self labelled images of diseased and healthy plants. Solution implemented utilized tensorflow and transfer learning technologies.
