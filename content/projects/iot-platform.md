## Description

In this project, we will build our very own IoT platform. First, we learn how to setup a virtual server, install the necessary software and set up some required components. Next, we will learn how to integrate and add the MQTT and Node-RED features to our present platform deployment. We will then build our very first IoT project which will allow us to control an LED using our platform! Finally, we will add some much-needed functionality to our platform, including REST API support and the ability to send emails and SMS text alerts.
