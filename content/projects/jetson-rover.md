### ðŸ”— [Complete Project Tutorial](https://www.hackster.io/dhairya-parikh/nanobot-an-autonomous-mapping-and-surveillance-rover-1f8fd4)

## Introduction

There are several use cases where there is a requirement of a vehicle which can map unknown environments without any human assistance. Some of such use cases would be:

- *In Mines where humans cannot enter because of toxic gases like Sulphur Dioxide and Methane*
- *In case of natural calamities like floods and famine, such bots are of great help. They can transport materials like food and equipment to the needy*


## Description

In this project, we will build a autonomous device which will be very useful in the usecases defained above. We will use the **Nvidia Jetson Nano** as the brains of our project. Additionally, we will use a *1/10th scale remote controlled car* as the base for our project. The final project is shown in the cover image.

We will mount the entire system, which includes the Jetson Nano, controller for motor control and a LIDAR sensor for environment sensing. This is a fairly complex project which requires some experience using linux and handling hardware. 

I have written the entire tutorial in a very straight forward and easy to understand language with some great images throughout the article so that you can follow it without any problems. The link above takes you to the **Hackster** project page for this rover.
